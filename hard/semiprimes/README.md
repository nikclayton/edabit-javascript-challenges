A semiprime is a composite number that is the product of two primes. Apart from these two primes, its only other proper (non-self) divisor is 1.

The two prime factors of a semiprime can be the same number (e.g. the semiprime 49 is the product of 7x7). A semiprime that has two *distinct*prime factors is called a ***squarefree semiprime.***

Create a function that takes a number and returns `"Squarefree Semiprime"`, `"Semiprime"`, or `"Neither"`.
