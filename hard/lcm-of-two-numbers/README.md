Write a function that returns the **least common multiple (LCM)**of two integers.


### Examples ###
    lcm(9, 18) ➞ 18

    lcm(8, 5) ➞ 40

    lcm(17, 11) ➞ 187


### Notes ###
*   Both values will be positive.
*   The **LCM**is the smallest integer that divides both numbers such that the remainder is zero.
