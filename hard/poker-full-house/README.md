Create a function that determines whether or not a player is holding a **Full House**in their hand. A hand is represented as an array of 5 cards. A full house is defined as a pair of cards and a three-of-a-kind.

To illustrate: `["A", "A", "A", "K", "K"]`would be a **Full House**, since the player holds 3 aces and 2 kings.


### Examples ###
    isFullHouse(["A", "A", "A", "K", "K"]) ➞ true

    isFullHouse(["3", "J", "J", "3", "3"]) ➞ true

    isFullHouse(["10", "J", "10", "10", "10"]) ➞ false

    isFullHouse(["7", "J", "3", "4", "2"]) ➞ false
