This is a **reverse coding challenge**. Normally you're given explicit directions with how to create a function. Here, you must generate your own function to satisfy the relationship between the inputs and outputs.

Your task is to create a function that, when fed the inputs below, produce the sample outputs shown.


### Examples ###
    "hello" ➞ [4, 1, 3, 3, 1]

    "maybe" ➞ [4, 2, 1, 3, 1]

    "hopeless" ➞ [0, 7, 0, 5, 4, 5, 3, 3]

    "higher" ➞ [2, 3, 1, 2, 5, 0]

    "movement" ➞ [5, 7, 6, 5, 5, 5, 6, 4]
