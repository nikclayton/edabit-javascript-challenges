Write a function that returns the minimum number of swaps to convert the first binary string into the second.


### Examples ###
    minSwaps("1100", "1001") ➞ 1

    minSwaps("110011", "010111") ➞ 1

    minSwaps("10011001", "01100110") ➞ 4


### Notes ###
*   Both binary strings will be of equal length.
*   Both binary strings will have an equal number of zeroes and ones.
*   A swap is switching two elements in a string (swaps do **not**have to be adjacent).
