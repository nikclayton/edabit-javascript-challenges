In early recorded Chinese history, time was reckoned using the sexagenary (60-year) cycle, generated from two subcycles:

1.  Five heavenly stems (elements) in this order: wood, fire, earth, metal, water. The stems change every two years.
2.  Twelve earthly branches (animals) in this order: rat, ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, sheep, monkey, rooster, dog, pig. The branches change yearly.

The combinations between these two sub-cycles result in a 60-year cycle where no two years are the same — for example, the 5 years of the Rat have 5 different elements: 1924 Wood Rat, 1936 Fire Rat, 1948 Earth Rat, 1960 Metal Rat, 1972 Water Rat.

The first 14 years of the current cycle are shown in the table below:

These days, the sexagenary cycle is used mainly for historical celebrations and events, and in Chinese astrology. The Gregorian calendar is now the standard means of reckoning time.

Create a function that takes a number representing a year in the Gregorian calendar, and returns a string consisting of the corresponding stem-and-branch combination in the sexagenary cycle.
