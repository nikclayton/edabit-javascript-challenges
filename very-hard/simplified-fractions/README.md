Create a function that returns the simplified version of a fraction.


### Examples ###
    simplify("4/6") ➞ "2/3"

    simplify("10/11") ➞ "10/11"

    simplify("100/400") ➞ "1/4"

    simplify("8/4") ➞ "2"


### Notes ###
*   A fraction is simplified if there are no common factors (except 1) between the numerator and the denominator. For example, `4/6`is **not**simplified, since `4`and `6`both share `2`as a factor.
*   If improper fractions can be transformed into integers, do so in your code (see example #4).
