A **set**is a collection of unique items. A **set**can be formed from an array from removing all duplicate items.

    [1, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5]
    // original array

    [1, 3, 5]
    // original array transformed into a set

Create a function that transforms an array into a set.


### Examples ###
    set([1, 3, 3, 5, 5]) ➞ [1, 3, 5]

    set([4, 4, 4, 4]) ➞ [4]

    set([5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15]) ➞ [5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15]


### Notes ###
Note: For this question, output **an array, not a set**. These are two distinctly different data structures in Javascript (although they can be converted from one to the other).

See resources for a hint if you get stuck.
