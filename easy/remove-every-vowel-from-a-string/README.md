Create a function that takes a string and returns a new string with all vowels removed.

### Examples

```
"I have never seen a thin person drinking Diet Coke." ➞ " hv nvr sn  thn prsn drnkng Dt Ck.")

"We're gonna build a wall!" ➞ "W'r gnn bld  wll!"

"Happy Thanksgiving to all--even the haters and losers!" ➞ "Hppy Thnksgvng t ll--vn th htrs nd lsrs!"
```

### Notes
- "y" is not considered a vowel.- Expect a valid string for all test cases.
