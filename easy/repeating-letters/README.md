Create a function that takes a string and returns a string in which each character is repeated once.


### Examples ###
    doubleChar("String") ➞ "SSttrriinngg"

    doubleChar("Hello World!") ➞ "HHeelllloo  WWoorrlldd!!"

    doubleChar("1234!_ ") ➞ "11223344!!__  "


### Notes ###
All test cases contain valid strings. Don't worry about spaces, special characters or numbers. They're all considered valid characters.
