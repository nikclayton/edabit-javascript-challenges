Create a function that takes a string and replaces each letter with its appropriate position in the alphabet. "a" is 1, "b" is 2, "c" is 3, etc, etc.


### Examples ###
    alphabetIndex("Wow, does that work?")
    ➞ "23 15 23 4 15 5 19 20 8 1 20 23 15 18 11"

    alphabetIndex("The river stole the gods.")
    ➞ "20 8 5 18 9 22 5 18 19 20 15 12 5 20 8 5 7 15 4 19"

    alphabetIndex("We have a lot of rain in June.")
    ➞ "23 5 8 1 22 5 1 12 15 20 15 6 18 1 9 14 9 14 10 21 14 5"


### Notes ###
If any character in the string isn't a letter, ignore it.
