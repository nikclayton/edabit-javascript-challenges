Create a function that takes a number as its argument and returns an array of all its factors.


### Examples ###
    factorize(12) ➞ [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12]

    factorize(4) ➞ [1, 2, 4]

    factorize(17) ➞ [1, 17]


### Notes ###
*   The input integer will be positive.
*   A factor is a number that evenly divides into another number without leaving a remainder. The second example is a factor of 12, because 12 / 2 = 6, with remainder 0.
