Create a function that takes a single character as an argument and returns the char code of its lowercased / uppercased counterpart.


### Examples ###
    Given that:
      - "A" char code is: 65
      - "a" char code is: 97

    counterpartCharCode("A") ➞ 97

    counterpartCharCode("a") ➞ 65


### Notes ###
*   The argument will always be a single character.
*   Not all inputs will have a counterpart (e.g. numbers), in which case return the inputs char code.
