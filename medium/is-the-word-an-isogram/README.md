An isogram is a word that has no repeating letters, consecutive or nonconsecutive. Create a function that takes a string and returns either `true`or `false`depending on whether or not it's an "isogram".


### Examples ###
    isIsogram("Algorism") ➞ true

    isIsogram("PasSword") ➞ false (not case sensitive)

    isIsogram("Consecutive") ➞ false


### Notes ###
*   Ignore letter case (should not be case sensitive).
*   All test cases contain valid one word strings.
