Create a function that tests whether or not an integer is a **perfect number**. A perfect number is a number that can be written as the sum of its factors, excluding the number itself.

For example, 6 is a **perfect number**, since 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, where 1, 2, and 3 are all factors of 6. Similarly, 28 is a **perfect number**, since 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28.


### Examples ###
    checkPerfect(6) ➞ true

    checkPerfect(28) ➞ true

    checkPerfect(496) ➞ true

    checkPerfect(12) ➞ false

    checkPerfect(97) ➞ false
