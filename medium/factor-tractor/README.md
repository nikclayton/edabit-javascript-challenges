Write a program to find all the prime factors of a given number. The program must return an array containing all the prime factors, sorted in ascending order. Remember that *1 is neither prime nor composite*and should not be included in your output array.


### Examples ###
    primeFactorize(25) ➞ [5, 5]

    primeFactorize(19) ➞ [19]

    primeFactorize(77) ➞ [7, 11]


### Notes ###
*   Output array must be sorted in ascending order
*   The only positive integer which is neither prime nor composite is 1. Return an empty array if 1 is the input.
