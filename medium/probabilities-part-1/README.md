Given an array of numbers and a value *n*, write a function that returns the probability of choosing a number greater than or equal to *n*from the array. The probability should be expressed as a percentage, rounded to one decimal place.


### Examples ###
    probability([5, 1, 8, 9], 6) ➞ 50.0

    probability([7, 4, 17, 14, 12, 3], 16) ➞ 16.7

    probability([4, 6, 2, 9, 15, 18, 8, 2, 10, 8], 6) ➞ 70.0


### Notes ###
Probability of event = (num of favourable outcomes) / (total num of possible outcomes)
