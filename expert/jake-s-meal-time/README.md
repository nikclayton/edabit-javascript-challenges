Jake is a very habitual person. He eats breakfast at 7:00 a.m. each morning, lunch at 12:00 p.m. and dinner at 7:00 p.m. in the evening.

Create a function that takes in the current time as a string and determines the duration of time before Jake's next meal. Represent this as an array with the first and second elements representing hours and minutes, respectively.
