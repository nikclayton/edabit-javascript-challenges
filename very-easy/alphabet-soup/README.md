Create a function that takes a string and returns a string with its letters in alphabetical order.


### Examples ###
    AlphabetSoup("hello") ➞ "ehllo"

    AlphabetSoup("edabit") ➞ "abdeit"

    AlphabetSoup("hacker") ➞ "acehkr"

    AlphabetSoup("geek") ➞ "eegk"

    AlphabetSoup("javascript") ➞ "aacijprstv"


### Notes ###
You can assume numbers and punctuation symbols won't be included in test cases. You'll only have to deal with single word, alphabetic characters.
