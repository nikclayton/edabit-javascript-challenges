Create a function that takes a string  and returns a string with its letters in alphabetical order.

### Examples

```
"hello" ➞ "ehllo"

"edabit" ➞ "abdeit"

"hacker" ➞ "acehkr"

"geek" ➞ "eegk"

"javascript" ➞ "aacijprstv"
```

### Notes

You can assume numbers and punctuation symbols won't be included in test cases. You'll only have to deal with single word, alphabetic characters.
