You are given 2 out of 3 of the angles in a triangle, in degrees.

Write a function that classifies the missing angle as either `"acute"`, `"right"`, or `"obtuse"`based on its degrees.

*   An **acute**angle is one smaller than 90 degrees.
*   A **right**angle is one that is exactly 90 degrees.
*   An **obtuse**angle is one greater than 90 degrees (but smaller than 180 degrees).

For example: `missingAngle(11, 20)`should return `"obtuse"`, since the missing angle would be 149 degrees, which makes it obtuse.


### Examples ###
    missingAngle(27, 59) ➞ "obtuse"

    missingAngle(135, 11) ➞ "acute"

    missingAngle(45, 45) ➞ "right"


### Notes ###
The sum of angles of any triangle is always 180 degrees.
