In this exercise you will have to:

*   Take a list of names.
*   Add "Hello" to every name.
*   Make one big string with all greetings.

The solution should be one string with a comma in between every "Hello (Name)".


### Examples ###
    greetPeople(["Joe"]) ➞ "Hello Joe"

    greetPeople(["Angela", "Joe"]) ➞ "Hello Angela, Hello Joe"

    greetPeople(["Frank", "Angela", "Joe"]) ➞ "Hello Frank, Hello Angela, Hello Joe"


### Notes ###
*   Each greeting has to be separated with a comma and a space.
*   If you're given an empty array `[]`, return an empty string `""`.
