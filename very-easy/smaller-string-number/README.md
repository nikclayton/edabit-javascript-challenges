Create a function that returns the smaller number.


### Examples ###
    smallerNum("21", "44") ➞ "21"

    smallerNum("1500", "1") ➞ "1"

    smallerNum("5", "5") ➞ "5"


### Notes ###
*   Numbers will be represented as strings, and your output should also be a string.
*   If both numbers tie, return either number.
*   Numbers will be positive.
*   **Bonus**: See if you can do this **without**converting to integers.
