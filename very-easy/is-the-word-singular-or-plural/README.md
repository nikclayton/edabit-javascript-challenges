Create a function that takes in a word and determines whether or not it is plural. A plural word is one that ends in "s".


### Examples ###
    isPlural("changes") ➞ true

    isPlural("change") ➞ false

    isPlural("dudes") ➞ true

    isPlural("magic") ➞ false


### Notes ###
*   Don't forget to `return`the result.
*   Remember that return `true`(*boolean*) is not the same as return `"true"`(*string*).
*   This is an oversimplification of the English language. We are ignoring edge cases like "goose" and "geese", "fungus" and "fungi", etc.
